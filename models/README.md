Models saved using the `torch.save` function are saved as `.pt` files. These files can be loaded using the `torch.load` function. The `torch.save` function saves the model's state_dict, which contains the model's weights and biases. The model's architecture must be defined in the code before loading the model.

    ```python
    # Save the model
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pt')

    # Load the model
    model = Model()
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pt'))
    model.eval()
    ```

The model must be in evaluation mode after loading the model using `model.eval()`. This is because some layers like dropout and batch normalization behave differently during training and evaluation.
